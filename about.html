<p>I am currently studying third-year Software Engineering at University of Auckland and looking for new challenges and willing to help other people and develop my skills in cooperating in a team. As a front-end developer at LoveLive Limited, I understand the importance of collaboration in a team. I am excited to join this company and start a new journey with you.</p>
