### What is it?

Giscus is a comments management system powered by [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)

### Similar products

There are quite a few alternatives such as utterance [uses GitHub issues]. But I also think it makes more sense to use  [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for managing comments.

Head over to [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for more info.

### Integrate with Jekyll

store the information in _config.yaml:

you can also simply just use the script generated by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) 

```jsx
giscus:
  repo:                "[your-repo-name]"
  repo-id:             "[your-repo-id]"
  category:            "General"
  category-id:         "[your-category-id]"
  mapping:             "pathname"
  reaction-enabled:    "1"
  theme:               "dark_dimmed"
  crossorigin:         "anonymous"
```

Put the script tag in a global position such as default or post layout, so you can use it any where 

```jsx
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
  data-repo={{ site.giscus.repo }}
  data-repo-id={{ site.giscus.repo-id }}
  data-category={{ site.giscus.category }}
  data-category-id={{ site.giscus.category-id }}
  data-mapping={{ site.giscus.mapping }}
  data-reactions-enabled={{ site.giscus.reaction-enabled }}
  data-theme={{ site.giscus.theme }}
  crossorigin={{ site.giscus.crossorigin }}
  async>
</script>
```

now remember to put this in the place you want to have comments

```jsx
<div class="giscus"></div>
```

Because if an element with the class `giscus`exists, the comments will be placed there instead.
