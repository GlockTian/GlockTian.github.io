## Basic

A Partial class enables us to put definition of a [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class), a [struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct), an [interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface) or a method over two or more source files within the project. The compiler will be responsible to merge all parts together.

## Example:

What the class Looks like in the code base

```csharp
public partial class Employee
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
    }
}

public partial class Employee
{
    public void GoToLunch()
    {
    }
}
```

What the compiler thinks we have

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
    }
    public void GoToLunch()
    {
    }
}
```

## Scenario:

- When working on large projects, spreading a class over separate files enables multiple programmers to work on it at the same time.
- Code can be added to the class without having to recreate the source file. Use cases such as Windows Forms, Web service wrapper code, and so on; we can create code that uses these classes without having to modify the file generated by Visual Studio.
- When using [source generators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview) to generate additional functionality in a class.
